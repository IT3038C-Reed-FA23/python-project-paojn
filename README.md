## Script Purpose

Explain what your script does here.

My script is a tool for cleaning up messy CSV data (the second idea you gave us). It removes duplicate rows and corrects formatting issues and ultimately saves a cleaned CSV. Users can specify which cleanup operations to perform using command-line arguments. The script provides clear error messages and informative success messages during execution.

## Self-Evaluation

How many points out of 85 do you deserve on this assignment: `0-85`

## Self-Reflection
<!-- What did you learn that you found interesting -->
Nothing this time around, I guess I wish I had something to test it against so not seeing a pass or fail for your script is interesting.
